Samples were ground with a precooled adapter set of the tissue lyser (Qiagen) for 2 min at 20 Hz. The frozen material was taken up in 1 ml TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) by vortexing. After removing the metal bullets, 200 μl chloroform was added. After mixing well, samples were centrifuged at 10.000 g for 10 min. RNA was purified following further instructions of the Trizol provided instructions. The purified RNA was eluted using RNAse free water. RNA absorbance ratios and integrity were checked by Agilent 2100 bioanalyser™. After extracting the total RNA from the samples, mRNA was enriched with oligo (dT) magnetic beads (Illumina). Fragmentation buffer was added to break the mRNA into short fragments (about 200 bp).  The first cDNA strand was synthesized by random hexamer-primer using the mRNA fragments as templates. The second strand was synthesized by adding dNTPs, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I. The double strand cDNA was purified with QiaQuick PCR extraction kit (Qiagen) and washed with EB buffer for end repair and single nucleotide A (adenine) addition. Finally, sequencing adaptors were ligated to the fragments. The required fragments was purified by agrose gel electrophoresis and enriched by PCR amplification.

A corresponding single ‘T’ nucleotide on the 3’ end of the adapter provided a complementary overhang for ligating the adapter to the fragment. The products were then purified and enriched using a PCR to selectively enrich those DNA fragments that have adapter molecules on both ends and to amplify the amount of DNA in the library. The PCR was performed with a PCR Primer Cocktail from the Illumina kit that anneals to the ends of the adapters.","SPOT_LENGTH: 200, Read_Index: 0  1 , Read_TYPE:  Forward  Reverse , BASE_COORD:  1  101 ",,2017-04-05 15:45:48,2015-12-10 06:09:49,11196443,2261681486,11196443,202,1271,,https://sra-pub-run-odp.s3.amazonaws.com/sra/SRR2984436/SRR2984436,SRX1473338,Sample_DschA_1h_sorbitol_I,RNA-Seq,RANDOM,TRANSCRIPTOMIC,PAIRED,ILLUMINA,Illumina HiSeq 2500,SRP067205,PRJNA305564,305564,SRS1199273,SAMN04328846,451804,Aspergillus fumigatus A1163,DschA_1h_I,LABORATORIO NACIONAL DE CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIA DO BI,SRA315994,B18E27201BA93B8643749CF4AAF8BF0B,03F7A5EE718CE206ED30932E3DC67DE2,451804 Aspergillus fumigatus A1163,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nan,['PMC5207228'],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/PMC5207228

We compared the A. fumigatus wild-type transcriptional response to osmotic stress with and ?mpkC, ?sakA, and ?mpkC ?sakA mutant strains.","A. fumigatus conidia (1x106 sp/mL) were inoculated into liquid YPD (1% yeast extract, 1% polypeptone, and 1% glucose) and cultured for 16 h prior to addition of 1/2 vol. 3 M sorbitol (Final concentration: 1 M). Mycelia were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen. For total RNA isolation, mycelia were ground in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), treated with RNase-free DNase I (Fermentas) and purified using a RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The RNA from each treatment was quantified using a NanoDrop and Qubit fluorometer, and analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system to assess the integrity of the RNA. RNA Integrity Number (RIN) was calculated; RNA sample had a RIN = 9.0 - 9.5.  Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit was used. Briefly, polyA containing mRNA molecules were selected using polyT oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation and paired-end library preparation was done using divalent cations and thermal fragmentation. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using reverse transcriptase (Superscript II) and random primers. This was followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H and dUTP in place of dTTP. AMPure XP beads were used to separate the dscDNA from the second strand. At the end of this process, we had blunt-ended cDNA to which a single ‘A’ nucleotide was added at the 3’ end to prevent them from ligating to one another during the adapter ligation reaction. A corresponding single ‘T’ nucleotide on the 3’ end of the adapter provided a complementary overhang for ligating the adapter to the fragment. The products were then purified and enriched using a PCR to selectively enrich those DNA fragments that have adapter molecules on both ends and to amplify the amount of DNA in the library. The PCR was performed with a PCR Primer Cocktail from the Illumina kit that anneals to the ends of the adapters. Libraries were sequenced (2x100bp) on a HiSeq 2500 instrument, sequencing approx. 17.3x106 fragments per sample.

Mycelia were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen. For total RNA isolation, mycelia were ground in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), treated with RNase-free DNase I (Fermentas) and purified using a RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The RNA from each treatment was quantified using a NanoDrop and Qubit fluorometer, and analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system to assess the integrity of the RNA.

We compared the A. fumigatus wild-type transcriptional response to osmotic stress with and ?mpkC, ?sakA, and ?mpkC ?sakA mutant strains.","A. fumigatus conidia (1x106 sp/mL) were inoculated into liquid YPD (1% yeast extract, 1% polypeptone, and 1% glucose) and cultured for 16 h prior to addition of 1/2 vol. 3 M sorbitol (Final concentration: 1 M). Mycelia were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen. For total RNA isolation, mycelia were ground in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), treated with RNase-free DNase I (Fermentas) and purified using a RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The RNA from each treatment was quantified using a NanoDrop and Qubit fluorometer, and analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system to assess the integrity of the RNA. RNA Integrity Number (RIN) was calculated; RNA sample had a RIN = 9.0 - 9.5.  Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit was used. Briefly, polyA containing mRNA molecules were selected using polyT oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation and paired-end library preparation was done using divalent cations and thermal fragmentation. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using reverse transcriptase (Superscript II) and random primers. This was followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H and dUTP in place of dTTP. AMPure XP beads were used to separate the dscDNA from the second strand. At the end of this process, we had blunt-ended cDNA to which a single ‘A’ nucleotide was added at the 3’ end to prevent them from ligating to one another during the adapter ligation reaction. A corresponding single ‘T’ nucleotide on the 3’ end of the adapter provided a complementary overhang for ligating the adapter to the fragment. The products were then purified and enriched using a PCR to selectively enrich those DNA fragments that have adapter molecules on both ends and to amplify the amount of DNA in the library. The PCR was performed with a PCR Primer Cocktail from the Illumina kit that anneals to the ends of the adapters. Libraries were sequenced (2x100bp) on a HiSeq 2500 instrument, sequencing approx. 17.3x106 fragments per sample.

RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols","Aspergillus fumigatus has to cope with a combination of several stress types in the human body, and the interplay between the different stress responses can significantly influence the survival of this human pathogen during the invasion of the host organism. In this study, we examined how the H2O2 induced oxidative stress response depends on iron availability. Surprisingly, the applied H2O2 treatment, which induced only a negligible stress response in iron fed cultures, deleteriously affected the fungus under iron starvation and the majority of observed transcriptome-level stress responses were characteristic only for the combined H2O2-iron starvation stress treatments. Our data suggest that the survival of the fungus highly depended on fragile balances, e.g. between siderophore and ergosterol productions or between economization on iron and production of essential iron containing proteins. The applied stress conditions also affected several processes related to virulence or drug susceptibility including secondary metabolism, zinc acquisition or antifungal drug transport. Our data clearly demonstrate that studying stress responses under single stress treatments is not sufficient at all to understand how fungal pathogens survive in a complex habitat and support the view that the evolutionary success of A. fumigatus as an opportunistic human pathogen is not the mere consequence of the productions of certain virulence factors. Importantly, this fungal pathogen is able to mount and coordinate high-complexity and outstandingly efficient responses to multiple and superpositioning stresses in various harsh habitats like the human body. Overall design: Control (untreated), hydrogen-peroxide treated, iron-starved as well as hydrogen-peroxide treated and iron-starved A. fumigatus cultures were studied in three independent experiments (3x4 RNAseq data sets).",,,29747589.0,2018-01-02 09:23:16,2017-02-13 10:47:34,16130904,806545200,0,50,541,,https://sra-pub-run-odp.s3.amazonaws.com/sra/SRR5249276/SRR5249276,SRX2555129,,RNA-Seq,cDNA,TRANSCRIPTOMIC,SINGLE,ILLUMINA,Illumina HiScanSQ,SRP099421,PRJNA374516,374516,SRS1972614,SAMN06324432,746128,Aspergillus fumigatus,GSM2484481,GEO,SRA537343,F50C55E123106FC8B6AE915D0126D00E,7465FE37AE1496891993FA0B40971896,746128 Aspergillus fumigatus,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29747589,[],

RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using standard Illumina protocols","Aspergillus fumigatus has to cope with a combination of several stress types in the human body, and the interplay between the different stress responses can significantly influence the survival of this human pathogen during the invasion of the host organism. In this study, we examined how the H2O2 induced oxidative stress response depends on iron availability. Surprisingly, the applied H2O2 treatment, which induced only a negligible stress response in iron fed cultures, deleteriously affected the fungus under iron starvation and the majority of observed transcriptome-level stress responses were characteristic only for the combined H2O2-iron starvation stress treatments. Our data suggest that the survival of the fungus highly depended on fragile balances, e.g. between siderophore and ergosterol productions or between economization on iron and production of essential iron containing proteins. The applied stress conditions also affected several processes related to virulence or drug susceptibility including secondary metabolism, zinc acquisition or antifungal drug transport. Our data clearly demonstrate that studying stress responses under single stress treatments is not sufficient at all to understand how fungal pathogens survive in a complex habitat and support the view that the evolutionary success of A. fumigatus as an opportunistic human pathogen is not the mere consequence of the productions of certain virulence factors.

Transcriptomic and proteomic comparisons between ?ppzA and wild-type strains under iron starvation showed that PpzA has a broad influence on genes involved in secondary metabolism. LC-MS under standard and iron starvation conditions confirmed that the ?ppzA mutant had reduced production of pyripyropene A (PPA), fumagillin, fumiquinazoline A, TAFC, and helvolic acid. The ?ppzA was shown to be avirulent in a neutropenic murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. PpzA plays an important role at the interface between iron starvation, regulation of SM production and pathogenicity in A. fumigatus.","Wild-type (CEA17) and _ppzA (5x106 spores) were inoculated in MM for 24 hr at 37Ą and transferred to AMM (glucose 1%, trace elements without FeSO_) plus BPS 200 mM [Bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid (4,7-diphenyl-1,10 phenanthrolinedisulfonic acid)] and 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis(4-phenylsulfonic acid)-1,2,4-triazine (ferrozine) 300 mM for 1 or 2 hr at 37Ą.

Iron is essential for organism survival due to its involvement in several biological processes. Aspergillus fumigatus causes invasive aspergillosis (IA), a disease that typically manifests in immunocompromised patients. A. fumigatus has two high affinity mechanisms of iron acquisition during infection: reductive iron assimilation (RIA) and siderophore-mediated iron uptake. It has been shown that siderophore production is important for A. fumigatus virulence, differently to the reductive iron uptake system. A. fumigatus PpzA, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase Z (PPZ), has been recently identified as associated with iron assimilation. Transcriptomic and proteomic comparisons between ?ppzA and wild-type strains under iron starvation showed that PpzA has a broad influence on genes involved in secondary metabolism. LC-MS under standard and iron starvation conditions confirmed that the ?ppzA mutant had reduced production of pyripyropene A (PPA), fumagillin, fumiquinazoline A, TAFC, and helvolic acid. The ?ppzA was shown to be avirulent in a neutropenic murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. PpzA plays an important role at the interface between iron starvation, regulation of SM production and pathogenicity in A. fumigatus.","Wild-type (CEA17) and _ppzA (5x106 spores) were inoculated in MM for 24 hr at 37Ą and transferred to AMM (glucose 1%, trace elements without FeSO_) plus BPS 200 mM [Bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid (4,7-diphenyl-1,10 phenanthrolinedisulfonic acid)] and 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-bis(4-phenylsulfonic acid)-1,2,4-triazine (ferrozine) 300 mM for 1 or 2 hr at 37Ą. Each condition was evaluated with three biological replicates. Mycelia were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground by mortar and pestle for total RNA isolation. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), treated with RNase-free DNase I (Fermentas) and purified using a RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The RNA from each treatment was quantified using a NanoDrop and Qubit fluorometer, and analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system to assess the integrity of the RNA.

Given that the MAT1 gene products are DNA binding master regulators that govern fruiting body formation, the MAT1-driven transcriptomes of A. fumigatus were monitored by conditional overexpression of either MAT1 gene followed by RNA-seq analyses.

In the filamentous fungal genus Aspergillus, the production of asexual spores is primarily governed by the BrlA-AbaA-WetA central regulatory cascade. The final step in this cascade, which is controlled by the WetA protein, not only governs cellular development (i.e., the morphological differentiation of spores) but also ensures its coupling with chemical development (i.e., the coordinated production and deposition of diverse secondary metabolites, such as aflatoxins, into spores). While the wetA gene is conserved across the genus Aspergillus, the structure and degree of conservation of the BrlA-AbaA-WetA regulatory cascade and the broader wetA gene regulatory network (GRN) remain largely unknown. We carried out comparative transcriptome analyses between wetA null mutant and wild type (WT) asexual spores in three representative species spanning the diversity of the genus Aspergillus: the genetic model A. nidulans, the agricultural pest A. flavus, and the human pathogen A. fumigatus. We discovered that WetA regulates asexual sporulation in all three species via a negative feedback loop that represses BrlA, the cascade's first step. Furthermore, ChIP-seq experiments in A. nidulans asexual spores suggest that WetA is a DNA-binding protein that interacts with a novel regulatory element, which we term the WetA Response Element (WRE). Interestingly, the WRE is found completely conserved in the non-coding region upstream of the wetA translation start site of many diverse Aspergillus genomes. In contrast, several global transcriptional regulators, most notably those in the velvet complex (veA, velB, and laeA) known to regulate the coupling between asexual development and production of secondary metabolites, show species-specific regulatory patterns. These results suggest that the BrlA-AbaA-WetA cascade's regulatory role in cellular and chemical development of asexual spores is functionally conserved, but that the WetA-associated GRN has diverged during Aspergillus evolution.

RNA libraries were prepared for sequencing using SMARTER mRNA-Seq Library Prep Kit standard protocols.,"Purpose : The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of Aspergillus fumigatus infected to macrophage-like cells for 0, 1 and 2 hours. Method : HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Gibco™ Antibiotic-Antimycotic at 37°C with 5% CO2. To induce the differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophage-like cells, HL-60 cells were stimulated with 50 nM 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PMA) for 2 days. A total of 10^3 A.fumigatus conidia were transferred to 5 × 10^4 differentiated HL-60 cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FBS. After incubating for 0, 1, and 2 hrs, the sample tubes were vigorously agitated with TRIzol® (Invitrogen) containing glass beads to extract total RNA of alive A.fumigatus. ). Libraries were prepared from 2 µg of total RNA using a SMARTer Stranded RNA-Seq Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., USA). Isolation of mRNA was performed using a Poly(A) RNA Selection Kit (LEXOGEN, Inc., Austria). The isolated mRNAs were used for cDNA synthesis and shearing, following the manufacturer's instructions. Indexing was performed using the Illumina indexes 1-12. An enrichment step was carried out using PCR. Subsequently, libraries were checked using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (DNA High Sensitivity Kit) to evaluate the mean fragment size. Quantification was performed using the library quantification kit with a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies, Inc., USA). High-throughput sequencing was performed as paired-end 100 bp sequencing using a HiSeq 2500 (Illumina, Inc., USA). mRNA-seq reads were mapped using the TopHat software (Cole Trapnell et al., 2009) tool to obtain an alignment file.

Exposure of the inducible brlA overexpression strain to low doses of doxycycline under vegetative growth conditions in vitro induced conidiation, while high doses arrested growth. Overexpression of brlA attenuated A. fumigatus virulence in both an invertebrate and mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. RNA sequencing studies and phenotypic analysis revealed that brlA-overexpression results in altered cell signaling, amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, including a marked up-regulation of trehalose biosynthesis and a downregulation in the biosynthesis of the polysaccharide virulence factor galactosaminogalactan. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that activation of the conidiation pathway in A. fumigatus can reduce virulence and suggests that brlA-inducing small molecules may hold promise as a new class of therapeutics for A. fumigatus infection.

Azoles have been used for many years as the main antifungal agents to treat and prevent invasive aspergillosis. However, in the last ten years there are several reports of azole resistance in A. fumigatus and new strategies are needed to combat invasive aspergillosis. Caspofungin is the newest class of approved antifungal drugs to treat aspergillosis. Although caspofungin is very effective against other human fungal pathogens, it is fungistatic against A. fumigatus and recommended as second-line therapy of invasive aspergillosis. Resistance to caspofungin in A. fumigatus have been linked to mutations in the FKS1 gene that encodes the target enzyme of the drug, beta-1,3-glucan synthase. However, tolerance to high caspofungin concentrations, a phenomenon called caspofungin paradoxical effect (CPE), is also important for subsequent adaptation and drug resistance evolution. Here, we have identified and characterized several transcription factors involved in the response to CPE by screening an A. fumigatus library of 484 null transcription factors (TFs) in CPE drug concentrations.

Caspofungin is the newest class of approved antifungal drugs to treat aspergillosis. Although caspofungin is very effective against other human fungal pathogens, it is fungistatic against A. fumigatus and recommended as second-line therapy of invasive aspergillosis. Resistance to caspofungin in A. fumigatus have been linked to mutations in the FKS1 gene that encodes the target enzyme of the drug, beta-1,3-glucan synthase. However, tolerance to high caspofungin concentrations, a phenomenon called caspofungin paradoxical effect (CPE), is also important for subsequent adaptation and drug resistance evolution. Here, we have identified and characterized several transcription factors involved in the response to CPE by screening an A. fumigatus library of 484 null transcription factors (TFs) in CPE drug concentrations. We have identified at least 11 TFs that had reduced CPE and nine of them showed to be more sensitive to lower caspofungin concentrations.","Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega) and purified using a RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions.

Recently, our laboratory characterized GprM as a modulator of the MpkA and MpkB pathway, pathways that may show mechanisms of A. fumigatus virulence. It has been observed that GprM interferes with the production of DHN-melanin, responsible for preventing the immune system from recognizing the fungus and triggering an immune response. Therefore, elucidating how GprM influences the MAP kinase pathway and the clusters of genes involved in the synthesis of DHN-melanin will provide insight into the virulence mechanisms of Aspergillus fumigatus, which can benefit immunocompromised patients.","Total RNA was extracted using Trizol  (Invitrogen), treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega) and purified  using a RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions.

Due to the small size of their conidia, the lungs are easily reached. Amidst the temperature, the fungus germinates and can cause damage to the host. Immunocompromised individuals are potential hosts as the immune system is unable to eliminate it in the early stages of infection and become victims of aspergillosis. Through signal transduction pathways, opportunistic fungi like A. fumigatus perceive the environment, modulate their metabolism in order to evade the host's immune system. GPCRs are examples of signal transducer pathways with at least 15 probable GPCRs identified in A. fumigatus, which have already been identified as likely pheromone and cAMP receptors and carbon and nitrogen sensors. Recently, our laboratory characterized GprM as a modulator of the MpkA and MpkB pathway, pathways that may show mechanisms of A. fumigatus virulence. It has been observed that GprM interferes with the production of DHN-melanin, responsible for preventing the immune system from recognizing the fungus and triggering an immune response.

SRR13387116,RNA-Seq of A. fumigatus wild-type strain mycelium in the presence of xylose 1% at 30 ºC (replicate 1),RNA-Seq of A. fumigatus wild-type strain mycelium in the presence of xylose 1% at 30 C (replicate 1),SRR13387116,,"Aspergillus fumigatus HsfA is homologue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae heat shock transcription factor Hsf1, which is the main regulator of the heat shock response in fungi. The present study investigated the short and long term transcriptional response of A. fumigatus to heat shock. We compared the transcriptomes of the wild-type and xylP::hsfA mutant strains at basal condition (30 oC) in the presence of xylose or glucose, and also after 15 or 60 minutes of heat shock (48 oC) in the presence of glucose.","Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen), treated with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen) and purified using a RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA from each treatment was quantified using a Qubit fluorometer and analyzed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system to assess the integrity of the RNA. Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit was used to construct cDNA libraries following manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, polyA containing mRNA molecules were selected using polyT oligo-attached magnetic beads. Fragmentation and library preparation were done using divalent cations and thermal fragmentation. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using reverse transcriptase (Superscript II) and random primers. This was followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H and dUTP in place of dTTP. AMPure XP beads were used to separate the dscDNA from the second strand. At the end of this process, we had blunt-ended cDNA to which a single A nucleotide was added at the 3 end to prevent them from ligating to one another during the adapter ligation reaction. A corresponding single T nucleotide on the 3 end of the adapter provided a complementary overhang for ligating the adapter to the fragment. The products were then purified and enriched using a PCR to selectively enrich those DNA fragments that have adapter molecules on both ends and to amplify the amount of DNA in the library.

Library preparation was performed using NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit for RNA-seq.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a human-pathogenic mold that extracts nutrients from the environment or from host tissues by secreting hydrolytic enzymes. The ability of A. fumigatus to adjust secretion levels in proportion to demand relies on the assistance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive stress response pathway that regulates the unique protein-folding environment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The P5-type ATPase Spf1 has recently been implicated in a novel mechanism of ER homeostasis that involves correcting errors in ER-membrane protein targeting. However, the contribution of this protein to the biology of A. fumigatus is unknown. Here, we employed a gene knockout and RNA sequencing strategy to determine the functional role of the A. fumigatus gene coding for the orthologous P5 ATPase SpfA. The data reveal that the spfA gene is induced by ER stress in a UPR-dependent manner. In the absence of spfA, the A. fumigatus transcriptome shifts toward a profile of altered redox and lipid balance, in addition to a signature of ER stress that includes srcA, encoding a second P-type ATPase in the ER. A DspfA deletion mutant showed increased sensitivity to ER stress, oxidative stress, and antifungal drugs that target the cell wall or plasma membrane. The combined loss of spfA and srcA exacerbated these phenotypes and attenuated virulence in two animal infection models. These findings demonstrate that the ER-resident ATPases SpfA and SrcA act jointly to support diverse adaptive functions of the ER that are necessary for fitness in the host environment.
